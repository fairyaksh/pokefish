# Pokesaur

Revisiting an idea that I'd conjured up way back in 2020 and giving it a few polishes.

## What's the point?

- The idea was cool but I didn't get around to executing it to my full satisfaction
- Play with React again (it's been a while! also CRA is deprecated?! ... yes, it's been a <i>while</i>)
- Fix the frustrating bug preventing data from being fetched
- Work on making it fully responsive for all screen sizes
- I love the original UI choice I made and would like to see it come alive

## Tech Stack

Main:

- React
- Vite

Integrations:

- <strike>Fishbase API</strike>
- [DinoAPI](https://github.com/darkmoonsk/dinoapi)

## Features / Roadmap

ðŸš§ Planned Improvements:

- Important:

  - Fix existing API bug
    - Found out that the reason for the failure is due to the API being [deprecated](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/is-the-fishbase-api-still-operational-and-available-for-public-use/3169/1) for Web API use.
  - Setup a development branch (git) and environment (netlify)
  - Introduce a back button to the landing page

- Future/Nice to Have:
  - Improve the user journey!
  - Fully flesh out the UI while keeping the style
  - Testing (Need to do more research into how I can implement this)
